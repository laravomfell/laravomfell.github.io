Following a panel of 36,000 searches by 1,100 police officers at a major English police force, we provide officer-specific measures of over-searching relative to two baselines: the ethnic composition of crime suspects officers interact with and the ethnic composition of the areas they patrol. We show that the vast majority of officers over-search ethnic minorities against both baselines. But we also find that the over-searching by individual officers cannot account for all of over-representation of ethnic minorities in stop and search: Over-patrolling of minority areas is also a key factor. Decomposing the overall search bias we find that the over-representation of Asian people is primarily due to over-patrolling while the over-representation of Black people is a combination of officer and patrol effects, with the larger contribution coming from officers' biases.","tags":[],"title":"Officer bias in stop and search is exacerbated by deployment decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Vomfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555714800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572432473,"objectID":"2cff89c999ada8964ed567779b37e265","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/policy/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/policy/","section":"publication","summary":"Stop and search disproportionality has considerable impact on ethnic minorities living in the UK. The policy debate debate on search disproportionality is held back by flawed statistics. More seriously, the presentation of these statistics prompts behavioural biases, affecting perception of the seriousness of disproportionality. This limits the effective evaluation of proposed solutions to disproportionality. More concretely, there are three fundamental issues with the way disproportionality is reported and discussed: 1. uncertainty quantification, 2. base rate neglect and 3. reach quantification. I demonstrate how to quantify, report and visualize data to address the full picture of ethnic disparities in stop and search.","tags":[],"title":"To fix disproportionality, we have to fix disproportionality reporting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Vomfell","Wolfgang Karl HÃ¤rdle","Stefan Lessmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535756400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576157117,"objectID":"97077c2f8383621c711cb3cfaf5f04d4","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/crime_counts/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/crime_counts/","section":"publication","summary":"Crime prediction is crucial to criminal justice decision makers and efforts to prevent crime. The paper evaluates the explanatory and predictive value of human activity patterns derived from taxi trip, Twitter and Foursquare data. Analysis of a six-month period of crime data for New York City shows that these data sources improve predictive accuracy for property crime by 19% compared to using only demographic data. This effect is strongest when the novel features are used together, yielding new insights into crime prediction. Notably and in line with social disorganisation theory, the novel features cannot improve predictions for violent crimes.","tags":[],"title":"Improving crime count forecasts using Twitter and taxi data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Stahl","Fabian Schomm","Gottfried Vossen","Lara Vomfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470006000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576157117,"objectID":"b4bfba4bb674a5ebcf3ce9fb70bdbfce","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/classification/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Trading data as a commodity has become increasingly popular in recent years, and data marketplaces have emerged as a new business model where data from a variety of sources can be collected, aggregated, processed, enriched, bought, and sold. They are effectively changing the way data are distributed and managed on the Internet. To get a better understanding of the emergence of data marketplaces, we have conducted several surveys in recent years to systematically gather and evaluate their characteristics. This paper takes a broader perspective and relates data marketplaces as currently discussed in computer science to the neoclassical notions of market and marketplace from economics. Specifically, we provide a typology of electronic marketplaces and discuss their approaches to the distribution of data. Finally, we provide a distinct definition of data marketplaces, leading to a classification framework that can provide structure for the emerging field of data marketplace research.","tags":[],"title":"A classification framework for data marketplaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Stahl","Fabian Schomm","Lara Vomfell","Gottfried Vossen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427842800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576157117,"objectID":"c2aa46e5efac7d67c7507d46c51930ce","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/marketplaces/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/marketplaces/","section":"publication","summary":"The newly emerging market for data is insufficiently researched up to now. The survey presented in this work - which is the third iteration of a a series of studies that started in 2012 - intends to provide a deeper understanding of this emerging type of market. Research questions concerning the provider manifestations and the commoditization of data are identified. The findings indicate that data providers focus on limited business models and that data remains individualized and differentiated. Nevertheless, a trend towards commoditization for certain types of data can be foreseen, which even allows an outlook to further developments in this area","tags":[],"title":"Marketplaces for digital data: Quo vadis?","type":"publication"}]
