Police forces typically argue that this is because they target crime perpetrators which happen to be of minority status. We investigate the evidence for this claim on a novel dataset of 2,161 police officers, 175,000 crimes and 38,000 searches by the West Midlands Police force in England. Exploiting external assignment to crime incidents, our work shows that police officers do not behave in accordance with that claim: Ethnic proportions in officers' searches are unrelated to the ethnicities of crime suspects encountered by officers or officer teams. Additionally, we find no evidence for stable officer bias across time. Instead, search behaviour is primarily driven by the ethnic composition of the officer's patrolling area which suggests that local neighbourhoods, not crime, drive search decisions. Finding no evidence for prevalent theories on the source of police bias, our work highlights the importance of analysing officer behaviour as the joint result of processes in the police, officer teams and local neighbourhoods.","tags":[],"title":"Police bias in stop and search, but not as we know it","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Vomfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555732800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555972240,"objectID":"2cff89c999ada8964ed567779b37e265","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/policy/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/policy/","section":"publication","summary":"Stop and search disproportionality has considerable impact on ethnic minorities living in the UK. The policy debate debate on search disproportionality is held back by flawed statistics. More seriously, the presentation of these statistics prompts behavioural biases, affecting perception of the seriousness of disproportionality. This limits the effective evaluation of proposed solutions to disproportionality. More concretely, there are three fundamental issues with the way disproportionality is reported and discussed: 1. uncertainty quantification, 2. base rate neglect and 3. reach quantification. I demonstrate how to quantify, report and visualize data to address the full picture of ethnic disparities in stop and search.","tags":[],"title":"To fix disproportionality, we have to fix disproportionality reporting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Vomfell","Wolfgang Karl HÃ¤rdle","Stefan Lessmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555945343,"objectID":"97077c2f8383621c711cb3cfaf5f04d4","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/crime_counts/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/crime_counts/","section":"publication","summary":"Crime prediction is crucial to criminal justice decision makers and efforts to prevent crime. The paper evaluates the explanatory and predictive value of human activity patterns derived from taxi trip, Twitter and Foursquare data. Analysis of a six-month period of crime data for New York City shows that these data sources improve predictive accuracy for property crime by 19% compared to using only demographic data. This effect is strongest when the novel features are used together, yielding new insights into crime prediction. Notably and in line with social disorganisation theory, the novel features cannot improve predictions for violent crimes.","tags":[],"title":"Improving crime count forecasts using Twitter and taxi data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Stahl","Fabian Schomm","Gottfried Vossen","Lara Vomfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470024000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549130692,"objectID":"b4bfba4bb674a5ebcf3ce9fb70bdbfce","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/classification/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Trading data as a commodity has become increasingly popular in recent years, and data marketplaces have emerged as a new business model where data from a variety of sources can be collected, aggregated, processed, enriched, bought, and sold. They are effectively changing the way data are distributed and managed on the Internet. To get a better understanding of the emergence of data marketplaces, we have conducted several surveys in recent years to systematically gather and evaluate their characteristics. This paper takes a broader perspective and relates data marketplaces as currently discussed in computer science to the neoclassical notions of market and marketplace from economics. Specifically, we provide a typology of electronic marketplaces and discuss their approaches to the distribution of data. Finally, we provide a distinct definition of data marketplaces, leading to a classification framework that can provide structure for the emerging field of data marketplace research.","tags":[],"title":"A classification framework for data marketplaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Stahl","Fabian Schomm","Lara Vomfell","Gottfried Vossen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549130692,"objectID":"c2aa46e5efac7d67c7507d46c51930ce","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/marketplaces/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/marketplaces/","section":"publication","summary":"The newly emerging market for data is insufficiently researched up to now. The survey presented in this work - which is the third iteration of a a series of studies that started in 2012 - intends to provide a deeper understanding of this emerging type of market. Research questions concerning the provider manifestations and the commoditization of data are identified. The findings indicate that data providers focus on limited business models and that data remains individualized and differentiated. Nevertheless, a trend towards commoditization for certain types of data can be foreseen, which even allows an outlook to further developments in this area","tags":[],"title":"Marketplaces for digital data: Quo vadis?","type":"publication"}]
