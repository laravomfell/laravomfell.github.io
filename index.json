The paper evaluates the explanatory and predictive value of human activity patterns derived from taxi trip, Twitter and Foursquare data. Analysis of a six-month period of crime data for New York City shows that these data sources improve predictive accuracy for property crime by 19% compared to using only demographic data. This effect is strongest when the novel features are used together, yielding new insights into crime prediction. Notably and in line with social disorganisation theory, the novel features cannot improve predictions for violent crimes.","tags":[],"title":"Improving crime count forecasts using Twitter and taxi data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Stahl","Fabian Schomm","Gottfried Vossen","Lara Vomfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470006000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549130692,"objectID":"b4bfba4bb674a5ebcf3ce9fb70bdbfce","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/classification/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Trading data as a commodity has become increasingly popular in recent years, and data marketplaces have emerged as a new business model where data from a variety of sources can be collected, aggregated, processed, enriched, bought, and sold. They are effectively changing the way data are distributed and managed on the Internet. To get a better understanding of the emergence of data marketplaces, we have conducted several surveys in recent years to systematically gather and evaluate their characteristics. This paper takes a broader perspective and relates data marketplaces as currently discussed in computer science to the neoclassical notions of market and marketplace from economics. Specifically, we provide a typology of electronic marketplaces and discuss their approaches to the distribution of data. Finally, we provide a distinct definition of data marketplaces, leading to a classification framework that can provide structure for the emerging field of data marketplace research.","tags":[],"title":"A classification framework for data marketplaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Stahl","Fabian Schomm","Lara Vomfell","Gottfried Vossen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427842800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549130692,"objectID":"c2aa46e5efac7d67c7507d46c51930ce","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/marketplaces/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/marketplaces/","section":"publication","summary":"The newly emerging market for data is insufficiently researched up to now. The survey presented in this work - which is the third iteration of a a series of studies that started in 2012 - intends to provide a deeper understanding of this emerging type of market. Research questions concerning the provider manifestations and the commoditization of data are identified. The findings indicate that data providers focus on limited business models and that data remains individualized and differentiated. Nevertheless, a trend towards commoditization for certain types of data can be foreseen, which even allows an outlook to further developments in this area","tags":[],"title":"Marketplaces for digital data: Quo vadis?","type":"publication"}]
